# NOTE: A second wire-level smoke test that opens GET /api/perception/feed
# via TestClient.stream() and asserts content-type was removed — the
# ASGI streaming response under TestClient does not unwind cleanly
# inside pytest (resp.close() doesn't signal the in-process generator,
# which then blocks on its is_disconnected() await). The wire shape is
# one f-string in routes/perception.py and is already covered by the
# bus-level test above. We'll exercise the live stream against the
# real container during the cutover slice, not here.
