# dotty-behaviour

Unraid-resident successor to the RPi-hosted `zeroclaw-bridge`. Hosts
the perception event bus, the 9 ambient-perception consumers, vision
and audio explain endpoints, the admin dashboard, the proactive
greeter, and the per-device caches consumed by all of the above.

Sibling of [`dotty-pi`](../dotty-pi/) — together they replace the RPi
bridge entirely. After this lands the RPi can be powered off.

Tracked under the dotty-behaviour rehoming slice of
[#36](https://github.com/BrettKinny/dotty-stackchan/issues/36).

## What this is

A FastAPI app pinned to `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` running on Unraid
in `network_mode: host`. xiaozhi-server (same host) talks to it on
`http://127.0.0.1:8090`. The container is a near-direct lift of
`bridge.py` + `bridge/*` minus the obsolete `/api/message` /
`/api/voice/*` / ZeroClaw stdio plumbing that PiVoiceLLM made
redundant in `#36`.

## Build + run on Unraid

```bash
ssh root@<UNRAID_HOST> '
  mkdir -p /mnt/user/appdata/dotty-behaviour-src \
           /mnt/user/appdata/dotty-behaviour/{state,logs,secrets} &&
  cd /mnt/user/appdata/dotty-behaviour-src &&
  # copy this directory tree here, then:
  docker build -t dotty-behaviour:0.1.0 . &&
  docker compose up -d
'
```

## Why a separate container

The bridge was a separate process on the RPi for the whole life of
this project, and that's been good — independent restart, debug,
profiling. Folding perception into xiaozhi-server would couple
event-driven background work with the latency-sensitive request path
(scene_synthesis fires 200-token narrative LLM calls; sleep_dreamer
fires multi-hundred-token calls; any of these blocking the xiaozhi
event loop is a voice-latency spike). Folding into `dotty-pi` would
make a polyglot container with two service managers. A peer container
preserves the operational shape that already works.

## Layout

Flat — this is an app that only runs inside its container, not a
distributable library. Modules sit at the top of the build context;
the Dockerfile copies them straight into `/app`.

Subsequent slices land:

| Slice                       | What it adds                                          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Outbound dispatchers        | `dispatch/xiaozhi.py` (admin client) + `dispatch/llm.py` (llama-swap narrative) |
| 9 consumers                 | `consumers/{face_greeter,wake_word_turner,face_lost_aborter,purr_player,security_cycle,scene_synthesis,idle_photographer,sleep_dreamer,dance_reflector}.py` |
| Vision / audio explain      | `routes/vision.py` + `routes/audio.py` + OpenRouter VLM/ASR clients |
| Greeter + household         | `greeter/` + `household/` (ported from `bridge/`)     |
| Dashboard                   | `dashboard/` + templates + static (ported from `bridge/dashboard.py`) |
| Calendar + weather          | `routes/calendar.py` + cache loops                     |
| State files                 | kid-mode / smart-mode toggle files                    |
| NDJSON writers              | `logs/` package (scene-synth, dreams, dances, idle-perception, security) |

## What gets dropped (vs the bridge)

- `/api/message`, `/api/message/stream`, `ACPClient`, the entire
  ZeroClaw stdio path — PiVoiceLLM is live; bridge no longer routes
  voice turns.
- `/api/voice/escalate`, `/api/voice/memory_log`, `/api/voice/remember`
  — `dotty-pi-ext` handles these inside the agent loop now.
- `bridge/speaker.py` — only consumed by `/api/message`.
- Smart-mode model-swap (rewrote RPi-side `~/.zeroclaw/config.toml`)
  — no Unraid equivalent; v2 scope per #36 if it returns.

## Cutover prerequisite

xiaozhi-server's `VISION_BRIDGE_URL` env var must change from
`http://<ZEROCLAW_HOST>:8080` to `http://127.0.0.1:8090`, and
`custom-providers/xiaozhi-patches/textMessageHandlerRegistry.py` must
have its perception-event POST URL retargeted the same way. Both land
in the cutover slice, not the scaffold.
