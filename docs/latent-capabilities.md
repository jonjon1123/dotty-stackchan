# Latent capabilities — features available but not wired up

## TL;DR

- Every row below is something the **hardware, voice pipeline, or brain already supports** but that the current deployment **doesn't use**. It's raw material for the backlog.
- Organised by where the capability lives: hardware, voice pipeline, brain.
- Each row ends with a cross-reference: a related `ROADMAP.md` item, or flagged as a **new-task candidate** if no backlog entry exists yet.
- Treat this as a menu, not a plan — some are cheap wins, others are complex.

## Hardware — unused

Underlying peripherals on the M5Stack CoreS3 / StackChan kit that the firmware doesn't currently expose through MCP.

| Capability | What it unlocks | Priority | Cross-ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| **9-axis IMU shake/gesture** (BMI270 + BMM150) | Tap-to-activate, shake-to-dismiss, head-tilt-aware responses | Medium | **New-task candidate** |
| **Proximity sensor** (LTR-553ALS) | Wake-on-approach; auto-dim face at idle | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **Ambient-light** (same sensor) | Match face brightness to room lighting | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **NFC module** | Tap an NFC-tagged toy/card to trigger a scripted interaction | Medium | **New-task candidate** |
| **IR tx/rx** | Universal remote mode (learn + replay legacy appliance codes) | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **microSD slot** | Offline sound packs, local fallback voices, recorded memories | Medium | Partially overlaps `ROADMAP.md` → "Create backup script" |
| **3-zone touch panel** | Multi-zone gesture controls (head-pat as a discrete event) | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **Camera beyond `take_photo`** | On-device VLM preprocessing; streaming to a local vision server | Medium | Cross-refs `ROADMAP.md` → "Lock down for child-safe operation" (camera exposure) |
| **ESP-NOW radio** (Wi-Fi-band, no AP) | Peer-to-peer link to a second StackChan, or to the in-box ESP-NOW remote (see [hardware.md](./hardware.md#what-the-stackchan-kit-adds-on-top)) | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **In-box remote controller** | M5Stack ships a handheld ESP-NOW remote with the kit. Could drive states/toggles without voice — receiver-side ESP-NOW handling would need adding to the firmware. | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **Hardware-enforced privacy LEDs** | LED state wired to the peripheral-enable signal, not a software hint | **High / safety** | `ROADMAP.md` → "Hardwire privacy-indicator LEDs in firmware" |
| **Servo velocity/acceleration caps** | Calmer, safer, less-startling head motion | **High / safety** | `ROADMAP.md` → "Tame violent servo motion" |

## Voice pipeline — unused

Features xiaozhi-esp32-server supports upstream that aren't turned on or surfaced.

| Capability | What it unlocks | Priority | Cross-ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SenseVoice Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** | Use the *user's* vocal emotion as LLM context (not just the LLM's own emoji output) | High | **New-task candidate** |
| **SenseVoice Audio Event Detection (AED)** | Detect bgm, applause, laughter, crying, coughing, sneezing — useful context for a kids' robot | Medium | **New-task candidate** |
| **SenseVoice language-ID output** | Detect when the user actually spoke a non-English language; respond in kind or request clarification | Low | Cross-refs the English-pin patch `fun_local.py` |
| **Sherpa-ONNX ASR** | Alternative to FunASR; fully offline, supports different languages | Low | **Implemented (opt-in, #135)** — `SenseVoiceOnnx` provider, no-torch int8 export |
| **Custom wake word** | Replace/add to the stock wake word via ESP-SR MultiNet | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **Voiceprint speaker ID** | Distinguish family members; apply per-user persona/context | Medium | Cross-refs child-safety task (different guardrails for kids vs adults) |
| **xiaozhi-server VLLM module** | Server-side "What's in this photo?" pipeline | Medium | Already covered by the bridge-side `take_photo` + VLM long-poll path described in [`modes.md`](./modes.md#vision); this row tracks the *upstream* xiaozhi-server VLLM module, which we don't enable. |
| **PowerMem** | Dual-layer short-term + summarized memory (currently the `dotty-pi` agent owns memory via its FTS brain.db) | Low | Would overlap with the pi agent's memory — probably don't |
| **Intent router** (`function_call` mode) | Route simple commands (turn off lights, set timer) without round-tripping to the LLM | Medium | **New-task candidate** |
| **RagFlow knowledge base** | Retrieval-augmented responses against a household doc store | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **Multi-device routing** | Run the StackChan as one of several voice surfaces on the same pi agent brain | Low | Needs the full-module deployment (DB-backed) |
| **Piper streaming synthesis** | Lower first-audio latency than the current batch synthesis | Medium | `ROADMAP.md` → "Reduce first-audio latency" |
| **ffmpeg post-processing on TTS** | Robot-voice character via ring modulator / bitcrush / vocoder | Medium | `ROADMAP.md` → "TTS provider swap — robot-sounding voice" |

## Brain — unused

`dotty-pi` (pi agent + qwen3.5:4b on llama-swap) + `dotty-pi-ext` features that could be wired up.

| Capability | What it unlocks | Priority | Cross-ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Streaming first-token to TTS** | First-token TTS instead of waiting for the full response (perceived-latency win) | **High** | `ROADMAP.md` → "Reduce first-audio latency" |
| **Long-lived pi agent sessions** | Carry context across turns within a conversation without re-loading the persona each time | Medium | `ROADMAP.md` → "Reduce first-audio latency" |
| **Tool pre-approval gate** | Bridge confirms tool calls before they execute — useful for child-safety. | Medium | `ROADMAP.md` → "Lock down for child-safe operation" |
| ~~**Tool-use**~~ | **Wired up.** The `dotty-pi-ext` extension exposes 5 voice tools (`memory_lookup`, `remember`, `think_hard`, `take_photo`, `play_song`). | Done | — |
| **pi agent MCP-server mode** | Expose the agent's tools/memory to other MCP clients | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **Qwen3 `role: "system"` injection** | Move the English+emoji constraints into a proper system message instead of a prompt prefix/suffix; better MoE adherence | Medium | Rework of persona prompt structure |
| **Qwen3 extended context (96K native)** | Keep long conversation history / memory verbatim instead of summarising | Low | Costs more tokens per turn — probably not worth it yet |
| **llama-swap latency/cost dashboard** | Observability into per-turn inference cost on the local model | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **Model A/B for voice turns** | Test a smaller/faster model for chitchat, escalate to 27B-think only when needed | Medium | `ROADMAP.md` → "Reduce first-audio latency" |
| **Per-turn cost/trace surfacing** | Expose pi agent trace data via the bridge `/health` or a new `/stats` endpoint | Low | **New-task candidate** |
| **pi agent cron scheduler** | The robot could say "good morning" on a schedule, not just on demand | Low | **New-task candidate** |

## Cross-cutting — observability

None of these are feature requests — they're gaps in what we can *see* about the running system.

| Gap | What it'd unlock |
|---|---|
| Capture a real `tools/list` response | Ground-truth for the MCP tool table in [hardware.md](./hardware.md) |
| Per-turn latency breakdown | Which of ASR / LLM / TTS / network is the dominant cost |
| Per-turn cost breakdown | Whether Qwen3 via OpenRouter is cheaper than a smaller local model |
| Per-session trace diff | Whether English-sandwich is still needed after a hypothetical model upgrade |

These are all feeders for the **`ROADMAP.md`** "Map the dotty-pi ↔ xiaozhi-server ↔ StackChan firmware interaction" backlog item.

## Prioritisation rule of thumb

| Signal | Do it sooner |
|---|---|
| Child-safety or privacy | Always |
| Reduces perceived latency | Usually |
| Uses hardware we already paid for | Often |
| Requires an external service | Often skip |
| Needs the full-module DB deployment | Bundle for a future migration |
